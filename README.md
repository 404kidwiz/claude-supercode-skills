## 🚀 How It Works

### Auto-Discovery
Skills trigger automatically based on your task context:

```
You: "Help me set up a Kubernetes deployment for my microservices"
      ↓
[kubernetes-specialist-skill activates]
      ↓
Claude uses K8s expertise to guide you through:
- Deployment manifests (Deployment, Service, ConfigMap)
- Ingress and service discovery
- Rolling updates and rollbacks
- Monitoring and logging setup
```

### Progressive Disclosure
Skills load additional references on-demand:

```
Initial skill: < 500 lines (concise)
      ↓
When triggered, skill loads:
- Best practice guides
- Real-world examples
- Troubleshooting patterns
      ↓
Context remains focused until needed
```

### Tool Restrictions
Each skill specifies appropriate tool access:

```
security-auditor-skill:
- ✅ Can read: Security configs, test results
- ✅ Can write: Security fixes, reports
- ❌ Cannot: Modify production DB, deploy to prod
```
